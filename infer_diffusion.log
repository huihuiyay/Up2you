It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

Cannot initialize model with low cpu memory usage because `accelerate` was not found in the environment. Defaulting to `low_cpu_mem_usage=False`. It is strongly recommended to install `accelerate` for faster and less memory-intense model loading. You can do so with: 
```
pip install accelerate
